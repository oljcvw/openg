//! Unofficial async Rust client for the Grindr API, powering the
//! [Open Grind](https://opengrind.org) client.
//!
//! It talks to Grindr the same way the official Android app does: same TLS and
//! HTTP/2 fingerprint, same header order, same device identity. On top of that
//! it handles login, token refresh, requests, and the realtime websocket.
//!
//! It's only a transport — it doesn't ship types for individual endpoints. You
//! pick the path and deserialize the response body yourself.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! - [`GrindrClient`] — the main entry point. Cheap to clone, refreshes the
//!   token on its own, and runs the realtime websocket in the background once
//!   you opt in with [`GrindrClient::connect`].
//! - [`DeviceInfo`] — a fake but believable device identity.
//! - [`Session`] — credentials you can save and resume from.
//! - [`RawResponse`] — the status and body from a request.
//! - [`WsEvent`] / [`WsCommand`] — incoming and outgoing realtime messages.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use grindr::{DeviceInfo, GrindrClient, Method};
//!
//! # async fn run() -> Result<(), grindr::GrindrError> {
//! // Make a device identity once, save it, and reuse it next time.
//! let client = GrindrClient::new(DeviceInfo::generate(), None)?;
//!
//! client.login("user@example.com", "hunter2").await?;
//!
//! // Make a request — the session token is added for you.
//! let resp = client
//!     .request_authenticated_raw(Method::GET, "/v3/me/profile", None)
//!     .await?;
//! println!("status = {}", resp.status);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
