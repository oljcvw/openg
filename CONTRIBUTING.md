## Contribution guidelines

AI-generated pull requests are not allowed. AI-assisted code is allowed. All contributions must be aligned with [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

- Use American English spelling
- Internationalization is out of scope for now (see [#106](https://git.opengrind.org/open-grind/open-grind/issues/106)), so keep interface strings inline in American English, no translation layer and no partial translations
- Use [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com) whenever possible

## Getting started

**[Join the Open Grind developers chat in Matrix!](https://matrix.to/#/#dev:opengrind.org)**

To minimize effort and time spent on porting code across platforms, the project is built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) — a cross-platform framework running the same codebase on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS. Native clients are currently not planned but would be highly appreciated and featured.

Projects reference:

- **[grindr.rs](https://git.opengrind.org/open-grind/grindr.rs) Rust crate** — Grindr API transport layer, authentication, network calls
- **[Grindr Google OAuth WebExtension](https://git.opengrind.org/open-grind/grindr-google-oauth-webextension)** — a web browser extension that extracts a Google OAuth token for Grindr (used for Sign in with Google)
- **[Open Grind](https://git.opengrind.org/open-grind/open-grind)** — cross-platform Tauri application using **grindr.rs** and sharing code from **Grindr Google OAuth WebExtension** for non-Android Google OAuth flow
- **[Open Grind Google OAuth Android App](https://git.opengrind.org/open-grind/open-grind-google-oauth-android-app)** — a companion Android-only app that renders Geckoview with **Grindr Google OAuth WebExtension** embedded, needed because Android system's WebView blocks the Google OAuth page
- **[Grindr Web Unlock](https://git.opengrind.org/open-grind/grindr-web-unlock)** — separate web browser extension that bypasses web.grindr.com client-side paywall
- **[Grindr API developer tool](https://git.opengrind.org/open-grind/grindr-api-dev-tool)** — Desktop Tauri app that handles API authorization, security headers, request fingerprints for you and provides type hints for known fields

### Development environment

1. Clone repository with submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules ssh://git@git.opengrind.org/open-grind/open-grind.git`
2. Install prerequisites:
   - [Bun](https://bun.sh)
   - [Rust](https://rustup.rs)
   - [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun ci
   ```
4. Then start a dev server:

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

   - Run with `PUBLIC_ENABLE_BLUR_EFFECTS=1` to blur all avatars in the app.
   - Run with `PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEMO=1` to switch to SFW mock data.

### Project structure

[src/](./src/) — frontend built with Svelte
[src-tauri/](./src-tauri/) — backend built with Rust
[docs](./docs/) — Open Grind guides and Grindr API docs

API Authorization, security headers and transport layer are handled by Rust lib; this way the token can be stored securely without ever being exposed to frontend.

All research efforts contributing to [docs](./docs) are highly valued and appreciated! Search for "WIP" in [OpenAPI spec file](./docs/lib/openapi.json) to find out which areas of the API haven't been reverse engineered yet. OpenAPI is the source of truth for API reference documentation, which is generated from it automatically. If you want to contribute to documentation, please update OpenAPI spec file manually or using a GUI editor.

### Interacting with API

Use **[Grindr API developer tool](https://git.opengrind.org/open-grind/grindr-api-dev-tool)** to send requests to Grindr API.

<details>
<summary>API request example in JavaScript/TypeScript</summary>

```ts
const securityHeaders = {
	"L-Locale": "en_US",
	"Accept-Language": "en-US",
	requireRealDeviceInfo: "true",
	"L-Time-Zone": "Europe/Madrid",
	"User-Agent": "grindr3/25.20.0.147239;147239;Free;Android 13;Pixel 7;Google",
	"L-Device-Info":
		"1fAf9fB2aFfd47Fd;GLOBAL;2;3543028095;2400x1080;a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
	// modify L-Device-Info values randomly if you're getting ACCOUNT_BANNED at login stage
	// more info about these headers in docs: ./docs/content/grindr-api/security-headers.md
};

const req = await fetch("https://grindr.mobi/v8/sessions", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: {
		Accept: "application/json",
		...securityHeaders,
	},
	body: JSON.stringify({
		email: "yourmail@example.org",
		password:
			"comment out this field after you log in once, use authToken to refresh session",
		// authToken:
		//	"just reuse any of previous authTokens, even expired",
		token: null,
		geohash: null,
	}),
});

process.stdout.write("Grindr3 " + (await req.json().then((t) => t.sessionId)));
```

</details>

### Checks and tests

Before opening a pull request, run the same checks CI runs:

- `bun run lint` — ESLint. It reports each file as it starts by default; set
  `ESLINT_PROGRESS=0` for quiet output. Formatting is separate: `bun run format`
  (Prettier).
- `bun run check` — `svelte-check` type checking.
- `bun run test` — frontend unit tests (Vitest) and Rust backend tests (`cargo test`) together. Individually: `bun run test:unit` and `bun run test:rust`.

End-to-end tests are a separate tier:

- `bun run test:e2e` — Playwright. One-time setup: `bunx playwright install chromium`. It drives the web build and runs the browser serially, which is why it stays out of `bun run test`.

`bun ci` also installs a pre-commit hook (husky + lint-staged) that runs over staged files only:

- `*.{js,mjs,ts,svelte}` — Prettier, then ESLint with `--fix`
- `*.{json,md,yml,yaml,css,html}` — Prettier
- `*.sh` — ShellCheck
- `*.rs` — `rustfmt`, then `cargo clippy` over the whole crate

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) and [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) must be on `PATH`. `nix develop` provides both, along with the pinned Rust and Android toolchains.

### iOS builds

iOS builds use host-installed Xcode through the Nix-owned tool wrapper. Nix
provides Rust, Bun, Node.js, CocoaPods, XcodeGen, and supporting CLI tools; Apple
SDKs, simulators, signing identities, and provisioning profiles still come from
Xcode and the selected Apple developer account.

Select Xcode first, then use one of these explicit build outcomes from the
repository root:

```sh
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

# Default: unsigned debug simulator app.
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' run .#build-ios

# Unsigned debug device IPA: compilation/package proof, not installable.
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' run .#build-ios -- \
  --debug --target aarch64 --no-sign --ci

# Unsigned release archive: archive-structure proof, not distributable.
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' run .#build-ios -- \
  --target aarch64 --no-sign --archive-only --ci

# Signed TestFlight export. Requires local Apple Distribution credentials,
# matching App Store provisioning, explicit portal-mutation authority, and an
# explicit build number.
OPEN_GRIND_ALLOW_PROVISIONING_UPDATES=1 \
APPLE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=<AUTHORIZED_TEAM_ID> \
  nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' run .#build-ios -- \
  --target aarch64 --build-number 1061 --export-method release-testing --ci
```

`--export-method release-testing` creates a signed package suitable for
TestFlight; it does not upload it. Upload and internal-tester assignment are
separate, externally visible actions. Never add `--no-sign` to a candidate
described as signed, installable, TestFlight-ready, or App Store-ready.
Tauri asks Xcode to manage provisioning for signed builds, which can mutate the
Apple Developer portal. The wrapper blocks that path unless both acknowledgement
and authorized team are explicit; setting them is an authority decision, not a
generic build prerequisite.

Open Grind targets iPhone and iPad with iOS/iPadOS 17.5 or newer. A beta package
version such as `0.1.0-beta.7-dev` is normalized to Apple's three-integer
marketing version `0.1.0`; `CFBundleVersion` is the independently increasing
build number. See [iOS release preparation](docs/ios-release.md) for signing,
artifact verification, TestFlight, CI, and compliance gates.

## Inclusion in GOVERNANCE.md

**Criteria:** Once you have at least 1 accepted PR with significant changes (a feature, a bug fix, a section of documentation), you can request inclusion into GOVERNANCE.md. AI-generated PRs don't count, unless you have proven significant work and understanding of the subject beyond the AI-generated content.

**Action:** Please write a message to [#dev:opengrind.org](https://element.hloth.dev/#/room/#dev:opengrind.org) Matrix chat room requesting inclusion into GOVERNANCE.md. Once accepted, your git.opengrind.org username appears in the list, usually the position is determined by the amount of code you have contributed.

**Links:** You need to add a donation link after that to GOVERNANCE.md yourself by opening a PR, the commit must be signed with the same key and identity you have used for commits in your previous PRs.
